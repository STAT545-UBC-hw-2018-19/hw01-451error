#### Here are some quotes I like

> Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,  
> Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,  
> To the last syllable of recorded time;  
> And all our yesterdays have lighted fools  
> The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!  
> Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,  
> That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,  
> And then is heard no more. It is a tale  
> Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,  
> Signifying nothing.
>
> William Shakespeare, *Macbeth*


> I cannot live without books.
>
> Thomas Jefferson, a man who later died.
